# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Due to the amount of data, we are planning on using a combination of PgAdmin and Pandas Dataframes to clean and merge. Further analysis will be completed using Python scikit-learn and TensorFlow library.  

## Data Storage

File storage will be in an AWS S3 [bucket](data_files.md) along with the PostgreSQL database.

## Machine Learning

Scikit-learn and TensorFlow are the Machine Learning (ML) libraries we will be using to create our predictor.

We are planning to find out which model is the best machine learning model for our analysis. We will decide between the supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. With supervised, we would like to see if a regression model works to display the changes over the years. with unsupervised, we would like to see if the types of categorization or the posibility of displaying the data through a neural net to give it a total different outlook. Once we choose the best model that works best for our questions, we will connect it to the weather data.
