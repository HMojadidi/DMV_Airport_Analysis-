# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We are planning on using PgAdmin to clean the data due to the amount of data. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. 
We are planning to find out which model is the best machine learning model for our analysis. We will decide between the supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. With supervised, we would like to see if a regression model works to display the changes over the years. with unsupervised, we would like to see if the types of categorization or the posibility of displaying the data through a neural net to give it a total different outlook. Once we choose the best model that works best for our questions, we will connect it to the weather data.
